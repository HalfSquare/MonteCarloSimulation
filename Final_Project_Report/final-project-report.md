# ENGR 302: Final Project Report

**Group 15:** Monte Carlo Simulation Software Project  
**Client:** Andre Geldenhuis  
**Date:** TBC

## Project Objectives
The initial goal of this project was to create an extension to OpenRocket, an open-source rocket simulation software. This extension would allow the customer to run Monte Carlo simulations through OpenRocket. These simulations would take in mission control data (weather and rocket data) and a model rocket, and would run a number of simulations specified by the user. These simulations would be outputted graphically to the user, with options to save the output in various forms. This software would need to communicate with the Mission Control project software. The end goal was to also implement PID controller simulation for motor gimballing, and upwind rocket vectoring. 

## Summary of Project Results
Over the course of this project, our group designed a program to extend OpenRocket, to run Monte Carlo rocket simulations. The software uses OpenRocket as a library, and can take in weather and rocket data, and can output the simulation data as a 3D graph, as 3D rocket flight paths, as points on a map, or as latitudes and longitudes in a CSV. The software also has a built-in API to communicate with Mission Control project.
