3D graph video

 - Clusters are identified using a kmeans algorithm. The number of clusters is set by the user.
 - These clusters provide a representation of the most likely paths the rocket will take.
 - The closest simulated path to each cluster center is re-run to trace the path through 3D space.
 - These flightpaths are graphed on an interactive 3D graph.

 - This graph allows the user to see more information about the rocket's flightpath than is presented in the 2D scatter graph.
 - Shows overall stability, effects of wind, flight events like the parachute opening.
 - This detailed feedback allows the user to make more informed decisions about their rocket design and improve the overall design and flight plan.

# Jacqui - Mission Control integration

- The Mission Control integration with our Monte Carlo Simulation software allows Mission Control Teams to easily interact and use our software.
- We created an API which uses a command to run our Monte Carlo Simulation software without running the Graphical Interface.
- The command takes in parameters such as the CSV file path to import and value which determines if the Graphical Interface should be present.
